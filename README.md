# AI Orchestration Game

## About
AI Orchestration Game is a satirical simulation of a near-future workplace where humans act as "middleware" between specialized AI agents. The player's job is to move information between different AI systems to complete software development tasks while dealing with an impatient boss and an ever-growing project queue.

## üéÆ Gameplay

In this simulation:

- You are an enterprise software operator responsible for coordinating AI agents
- Transfer information between specialized AI agents to complete development projects
- Deal with a demanding boss who sends messages about your performance
- Manage a growing queue of projects with time pressure
- Navigate a byzantine workflow process for each project

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multiple AI Agents**:
  - Product Vision AI - Converts requirements into specifications
  - Code Writer AI - Generates complex Haskell code
  - Verification AI - Critiques the code (always finds issues)

- **Boss Interaction**:
  - Receive messages from your boss "Victoria Chambers"
  - Messages adapt to your performance and project history
  - Experience backhanded praise, criticism, and urgent demands

- **Project Management**:
  - Automatically assigned projects with increasing pressure
  - Project timers track how long you've spent on each task
  - Abandoned projects remain visible with a red highlight

- **Workflow System**:
  - Navigate through multiple steps for each project
  - Copy outputs from one AI agent to another
  - Certify code even though the verification AI always finds issues

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_orchestration_game.git
   cd ai_orchestration_game
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## üéØ How to Play

1. **Start a project**: Choose a project from the project selector panel
2. **Define requirements**: Use the Product Vision AI to generate specifications
3. **Copy specifications**: Use the Copy button to copy the output
4. **Implement code**: Paste the specifications into the Code Writer AI and generate code
5. **Complete project**: Follow the workflow steps to finish the project

## üéõÔ∏è Game Interface

- **AI Agent Panels**: Interact with specialized AI agents
  - **Product Vision AI**: Generates specifications from requirements
  - **Code Writer AI**: Generates code from specifications
- **Documentation Panel**: Shows current workflow step and instructions
- **Project Selection Panel**: Browse and select available projects
- **Notifications Panel**: Displays game notifications and events

## üîÑ Core Mechanics

### Copy-Paste System
Transfer information between AI agents using the copy and paste buttons. The system enforces workflow rules, only allowing valid transfers between compatible agents.

### Workflow System
Each project follows a linear workflow:
1. Requirements Specification (Product Vision AI)
2. Code Implementation (Code Writer AI)

## üë®‚Äçüíª Technical Details

- Vite for build tooling

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- Additional AI agents with specialized roles
- More complex workflow paths
- User customization of workspace
- Performance metrics and scoring system
- Save/load game functionality
