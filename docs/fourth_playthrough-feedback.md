- The "How To Play" intro is to specific. It's telling you what to copy and paste from. It should be telling you the high level flow instead.

- Lets try splitting up the right hand panel. I want Projects, Workflow Documentation, and Notifications to each hvae their own vertical panel.

- I was able to go through the entire project and see the congrats screen. Certifying the code worked.

- I like that the AI Agent text fields did not reset. Make the user keep track of everything.

- The Product Vision AI always generates the same outputs. For now lets leave it that way. we'll change it in the future.

- The task description says "Add some made-up requirements to the AI" . I want the copy to be more serious than that. This is a serious enterprise the user is working at!

- The "Current Step" in the "Workflow Documentation" panel never updates.

- Remove the "Ready" "Working" "Complete" labels from the AI panels. Too helpful.
