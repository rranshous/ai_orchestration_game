Playing through again

# Feedback
- i changed the model to `gemma3`
- the call to '/models' is not working, it's getting a 404
  - lets remove it
- update the AI agents to be backed by real models
  - i don't want static / hardcoded results form the agents
  - the calls to generate the boss' messages is succeeding

# Broken
- i can not finish the project due to the verification AI's content being too long.
  - I can't scroll down to get to the button




# model response
The model is responding with a stream of json objects
we need to update the model response handling code to handle the response as a stream of text fragments
