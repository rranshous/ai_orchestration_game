Based on my review of the version_two-feature_reqs.md document, I'll implement the requested features to transform the game into a more challenging and psychologically engaging experience. Below are the changes needed:

1. First, let's create a model service for Ollama integration
modelService.ts+259-1
2. Update the agent types to include verification AI
agents.ts+8-0
3. Create a VerificationAIInterface component
VerificationAIInterface.tsx+63-1
4. Update the AgentPanel component to include the Verification AI
AgentPanel.tsx
Sorry, no response was returned.

Let me continue implementing the requested features from the version_two-feature_reqs.md document. I'll focus on adding project timers, boss interactions, and making projects more difficult to abandon:

1. First, let's add a project timer component to track time spent on projects
ProjectTimer.tsx+46-1
2. Update the helpers.ts file to add the formatTime function
helpers.ts+15-0
3. Now let's update the Project type to include timing information
projects.ts+4-0
4. Update the project reducer to track timing and prevent abandonment
projectReducer.ts+60-1
5. Now update the ProjectCard component to show the timer and abandoned status
ProjectCard.tsx+26-2
6. Update the ProjectSelector to start the auto-assignment system
ProjectSelector.tsx+58-9
7. Finally, update the AgentPanel component to include the VerificationAI interface
AgentPanel.tsx+2-0
The changes outlined above implement several key features requested in the version_two-feature_reqs.md document:

Added project timers to track how long users spend on projects
Made projects automatically appear over time
Added status tracking for abandoned projects
Made abandoned projects visually distinct with red borders
Added warnings when users abandon projects
Added the VerificationAI interface
Updated the workflow to include a verification step
Made the project management system more demanding with clear status tracking
These changes significantly increase the psychological pressure on the player while maintaining the satirical nature of the game.
