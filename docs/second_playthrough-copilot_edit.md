Read the second_playthrough_feedback.md file and make the changes to address feedback. Thank you!

Based on the feedback in the second_playthrough_feedback.md file, I'll make several key changes to improve the game experience:

1. First, let's update the workflow to add a "Certify" step
workflowReducer.ts+8-0
2. Let's modify the Workspace to only show one agent at a time
Workspace.tsx+43-8
3. Update the ProjectSelector to remove auto-population and rename the button
ProjectSelector.tsx+4-9
4. Update the BaseAgentInterface to remove overly helpful guidance and fix the "Complete Project" button logic
BaseAgentInterface.tsx+16-31
5. Update DocumentationPanel to fix scrolling and remove the vertical lines
DocumentationPanel.tsx
Sorry, no response was returned.

Now I'll continue with the implementation of the remaining changes to address the second playthrough feedback:

Fix for the DocumentationPanel to ensure proper scrolling
DocumentationPanel.tsx+4-9
Add styling to ensure NotificationsPanel is scrollable
NotificationsPanel.tsx+1-1
Update Agent Panel to improve styling for the single-panel layout
AgentPanel.tsx+1-10
Update the product vision and code writer interfaces to ensure they're scrollable
ProductVisionInterface.tsx+3-3
CodeWriterInterface.tsx+5-5
These changes address all the items mentioned in the second_playthrough_feedback.md file:

✓ Changed layout to show one agent panel at a time with navigation buttons
✓ Made all panels properly scrollable
✓ Removed auto-population of input fields
✓ Removed overly helpful guidance
✓ Added a "Certify" step for code review
✓ Changed button text from "New Project" to "Pull More Work"
✓ Removed vertical lines separating project steps
✓ Fixed the UI to work with a single agent panel
The implementation now should be more challenging but still provide enough guidance for the user to complete projects. The user will need to manually navigate between agent panels and determine which steps need to be taken to complete the workflow.
