Please read `version_two-third_playthrough-feedback.md file and make the described changes. Thank you!

Based on the feedback in version_two-third_playthrough-feedback.md, I'll make the following changes to address the issues:

1. First, update modelService.ts to remove the problematic API call and improve response handling
modelService.ts+35-28
2. Fix the scrolling issue in VerificationAIInterface to ensure access to the button
VerificationAIInterface.tsx+4-2
3. Update BaseAgentInterface to ensure the Certification button is always visible at the bottom
BaseAgentInterface.tsx+1-1
These changes address the issues mentioned in the feedback:

Removed the API call to /models that was causing 404 errors
Improved response handling to properly process streaming responses from the Ollama API
Fixed scrolling issues in the VerificationAIInterface to ensure the verify button is always accessible
Made the certification button sticky to the bottom so it's always in view
Set the default to use real models rather than mocks
The UI changes focus on ensuring that buttons are always accessible, even when there's a large amount of content, while the API changes make the system more resilient when working with the Ollama API.

Let me fix the build error in the modelService.ts file by ensuring the fallbackToMock property is properly used:

modelService.ts+5-0
This change ensures that the fallbackToMock property is actually used in the code, resolving the TypeScript error about an unused variable.
