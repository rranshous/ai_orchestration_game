# Context

I gave copilot small updates to make instead of generating a whole file and feeding it in

# Copilot Edit convo

Split up the "Projects", "Workflow Documentation" and "Notifications" so that each of them have their own vertical panel. I want each section to have as much vertical room as possible.

GitHub Copilot
I'll modify the Workspace component to arrange the right-side panels side by side instead of stacked vertically:

Workspace.tsx
Workspace.tsx+14-10
Now the right section of the workspace is divided into three vertical panels side by side, giving each panel (Projects, Documentation, and Notifications) more vertical space. The Documentation panel is given more horizontal space (2 columns) since it typically contains more detailed information, while Projects and Notifications get 1 column each.

make the "Projects", "Workflow Documentation" and "Notifications" panels all the same width

GitHub Copilot
Let me update the Workspace component to make all three panels the same width:

Workspace.tsx
Workspace.tsx
Sorry, no response was returned.

continue

GitHub Copilot
Based on your request, I'll update the Workspace component to make all three panels (Projects, Workflow Documentation, and Notifications) have the same width:

Workspace.tsx
Workspace.tsx+1-1
Now all three panels will have equal width, each taking exactly one column of space in the grid. The right side now has three equally sized vertical panels, which should maximize the available vertical space for each panel.

rranshous
make the "Projects", "Workflow Documentation" and "Notifications" panels wider

GitHub Copilot
I'll update the Workspace component to make the three panels wider:

Workspace.tsx
Workspace.tsx+6-6
This change:

Reduces the Agent Panel width from 8/12 to 6/12 columns
Increases each right-side panel from 1/12 to 2/12 columns
Maintains the total 12-column grid layout
Now all three panels (Projects, Workflow Documentation, and Notifications) will be wider with more space for their content.
