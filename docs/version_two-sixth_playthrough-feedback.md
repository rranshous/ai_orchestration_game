# Version two sixth playthrough feedback

## Feedback
- Login screen looks good
- Lets not show the user the How to Play text before they play, let them figure it out
- The boss Agent is putting it's own 4th wall breaking commentary in it's messages
  - Message had at the end: `Do you need me to adjust the tone or add anything specific?`
  - Message had at the end: `Do you want me to draft a follow-up message if Boberty doesnâ€™t respond?`
- in the code writer AIs view the specification and Generated code boxes will get so long they go off the screen
  - it's also not scrollable
  - ensure the user is able to see all the response code
- the verification results were wrapped in tripple backticks which the user could see. It should be just the response text.
- there is no option for me to certify the code. Maybe because the verification result is a fail.
  - I see `Current Step: Code Certification` but no where in the UI to do so
- overall looking and feeling much better.
