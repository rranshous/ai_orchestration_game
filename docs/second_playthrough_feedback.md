Edits have been made based on my first playthrough

Lets see how it plays

# Feedback

- The introduction / help seems the same, fine

- having the code writer ai and the product vision ai both accessible in the interface is too easy
  - the use should have to select a different "tab" to switch between them. Maybe a next/previous scroll button set.

- The panel content is not scrollable.
  - On my screen the Workflow Documentation panel's content is being trucated and I can not scroll to see more

- I don't like that it auto populates the product vision AI prompt when I select the projects.
  - The projects tracking, the Product Vision AI and the Code Writer AI should all be treated as different subsystems which do not directly communicate.

- Same for " This agent is active in the current workflow step. Complete its task to proceed." It's too helpful. The user should have to figure it out and keep track of which AI to paste to.

- There is a bug: After the Product vision AI generates it's output the "Complete Project" green box and button appear on the bottom left. The project should not be compleable yet.

- I want to add another step to the users workflow. I want them to "Certify" the Code Writer AIs output. The project is not complete until the user has certified it.

- After I generate the code I saw an alert that makes me feel like I should be able to close the project but the green complete project box is gone. Can not complete the project.

- The notifications panel is also trucated and not scrollable.

- New Project button should probably be more like "Pull More Work" or something. The user doesn't get to decide to create a new project, only receive them.

- There is a vertical line seperating the Project steps. This is not necissary. The coloring and highlighting is good though.
