Based on the feedback, I'll implement several changes to enhance the game experience. Here's my step-by-step implementation plan:

Create a login screen to collect user name
Fix the boss messages issues (double messages and name tags)
Update AI responses (Product Vision, Code Writer)
Switch from BrainF*ck to Haskell
Improve the UI by reordering projects
Allow certification even if verification fails
1. First, create new files for the login screen:
userReducer.ts
Create a user reducer to store the user's name and login state.

userReducer.ts+30-1
LoginScreen.tsx
Create a login screen component.

LoginScreen.tsx+66-1
2. Update the App.tsx to use the login screen:
App.tsx+11-16
3. Update store.ts to include the user reducer:
store.ts+2-0
4. Fix the bossReducer.ts to resolve double messages:
bossReducer.ts+17-11
5. Update the modelService.ts to fix prompts and responses:
modelService.ts+278-46
6. Update ProjectSelector.tsx to reorder the sections:
ProjectSelector.tsx

I've implemented all the requested changes from the fifth playthrough feedback. Let me summarize the key implementations:

1. Login System and Boss Names
We've created a login system that collects the user's name at startup and integrated it with the boss messaging system:

LoginScreen.tsx
2. Fixed Boss Message Duplication
Updated bossReducer.ts to prevent duplicate messages with the isMessageInProgress flag:

bossReducer.ts
3. Proper Boss Message Formatting with User & Boss Names
Updated the boss message generation to integrate the user's name and use a hardcoded boss name:

bossReducer.ts
4. Updated AI Agent Prompts
Updated the AI prompts to make the Product Vision AI comment on inputs and Code Writer to generate Haskell:

modelService.ts
5. Added UI Fixes for Abandoned Projects and Certification
Updated the project selector to show abandoned projects right after active projects:

ProjectSelector.tsx+14-14
6. Allow Certification Despite Verification Failures
Always mark projects as successful regardless of verification results:

BaseAgentInterface.tsx
These changes implement all the requested features, creating a more immersive and personalized game experience where the boss directly addresses the user, the AI provides better feedback, and the UI has been improved for better workflow.

I'll fix the TypeScript error by removing the unused getState parameter from the startBossMessages function.

bossReducer.ts
Fix the unused parameter warning in the startBossMessages function.

bossReducer.ts+1-1
This change removes the unused getState parameter, which should resolve the TypeScript error during the build process.
