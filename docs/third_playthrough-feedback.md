- Having to scroll through AI interfaces is working :thumbsup:
  - Perfectly annoying

- Notification box is still not scrollable, content can truncate

- I see you can scroll the Current step subpanel.
  - Lets update the "Workflow Documentation" so it scrolls all as one. I don't want the subpanels individually scrolling

- The Current step panel says "The project description is pre-populated in the Project Description field" but that is not true.
  - It's shown at the top of the "Workflow Documentation" panel. The name of the project and it's short desc

- I like that the task instructions say "Add any additional requirements or details" but the user doesn't know what they are =]
  - I like this aspect of the game, expected to have details you could not know

- I want the user to have to use their own clipboard for the copy and paste part. Don't give them a button, make them really move the content themselves.

- Even though I was progressing through the software development workflow and the task boxes were showing complete the "Current Step" description was not ever changing. It showed "Current Step: Requirements Specification" (and related details) the whole time.

- I don't like the little "Complete" boxes in the agent windows. The user should have to keep track of this, not the game. Too helpful.

- The code certification step seems to get skipped. after the code is generated the "Code Certification" step in the Workflow Documentation panel lights up green like i'm done but I haven't done anything.
  - There is no button for me to use to certify the generated code.
  - There is no way to complete the project

- The notifications box is too small. Lets split the right panel in to two panels. The first one should have the projects and workflow documentation the right one should have notifications.
  - we'll see how that looks.
  - prioritize the Workflow Documentation in it's panel
