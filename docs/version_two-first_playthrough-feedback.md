# Context

We got version two up and running!

# Feedback

## Timer
- The timer starts immediately when i pick up a project and it stands out, good job!
- the completed project still shows the counting timer. we should stop the timer when the project is completed.
- The timer improperly resets when I reactivate an abandoned project.
  - I want the abandoned projects timer to be visible and still counting up the whole time
  - when the user picks back up the project I want the timer to have continued in the background

## Verification AI
- the verification AI feature appears to be missing.
- The verification AI step does not show up in the software development workflow
- there is no "tab" for the AI

## Software Development workflow
- bug: when I change projects the workflow state does not reset, it still shows the state from the abandoned project

## Static generation
- the responses from the AI agents is still static, this is wrong
- the responses fromt the AI's should be _real_ responses from the local Ollama model

## Pull more work
- the pull more work button is still there, it should be gone and work should just show up periodically

## Messages from the boss
- I did not see any messages from the boss

# Overall
Feels like several major features were missed
