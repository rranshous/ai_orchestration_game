# Context

## First impression

AI finished following the implementation plan. 

It had missed the index.html file so initially nothing worked.

I reported the app behavior and copilot edit fixed it

## Second impression

The game fired up after the fix

It gave me instructions, seemed good enough and not too much

closed the instructions

The overall game play screen looks pretty well laid out.

I clicked on on of the possible project (bug fix: login form)

I saw the popup in the lower right hand corner that the project was activated
- the popup obscured the contents of the notifications panel which made it confusing b/c the notification was also about the project being active

I see i'm in the Requirements Specification stage, it's active
- I see the explaination for this step

It's not clear to me where I should _get_ the product requirements.
- it wants me to put them in to the Product Vision AI's Project Description input box but I don't have any content for it
- i can no longer see the small description for the project which was in the "Projects" panel. It might have given me more info but once i selected the project I lost access to it's info.

I am going to paste the name of the project & make up a desription
- i entered: `Bug Fix: Login Form The login form is buggy, we've been getting negative user feedback about it.`

It generated the specification in the lower left box
- i like that it took a big and had the processing message

I'm left not knowing if I did it right. Was I supposed to make up the description.
- leaves me feeling like a confused jr and outside the fourth wall wondering if it was an intentional part of the game

The copy and paste buttons work without me changing the focus to the Code Writer AIs Specifications input box.
- seems like there is a part of the tedium that is focusing on the correct thing to copy and the correct thing to paste to.
- right now it's to _easy_ to get it right

After I used the Vision AI, copied it's output to the code writer AI and had the code writer generate the code my project status did not update. There isn't anything for me to do w/ the result of the Code AI. Feels like the "Software Development Workflow" panel should have been updating and there should be a next step.
