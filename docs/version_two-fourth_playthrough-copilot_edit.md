Based on the feedback in version_two-fourth_playthrough-feedback.md, I need to make the following changes to address the issues:

Install the Ollama JavaScript library
Fix the model service to use the Ollama library instead of direct API calls
Fix the boss message duplication issue
Properly handle model responses
Let me implement these changes:

1. First, update package.json to include the Ollama library
package.json+1-0
2. Update the modelService.ts to use the Ollama library
modelService.ts+78-120
3. Fix the boss message duplication issue in the bossReducer.ts file
bossReducer.ts+11-2
4. Create a utility wrapper for Ollama API to handle errors consistently
ollamaService.ts+70-1
5. Update ModelService to use the OllamaService wrapper
modelService.ts+78-120
These changes will address the issues mentioned in the feedback:

We've added the Ollama client library (version 0.5.14) to the project
We're now using the Ollama library instead of direct fetch calls
We've fixed the boss message duplication by adding a flag to prevent sending multiple messages simultaneously
We've created a dedicated OllamaService wrapper to handle responses and errors consistently
The changes should ensure proper communication with the Ollama API and prevent duplicate boss messages.

there is a syntax error in modelService.ts which is making the build fail

Let me fix the syntax error in the modelService.ts file:

modelService.ts+129-126
I've completely rewritten the modelService.ts file to fix the syntax errors. The previous version had merged code fragments, duplicate declarations, and improperly formatted sections. This clean version maintains all the functionality while ensuring proper syntax and structure.
