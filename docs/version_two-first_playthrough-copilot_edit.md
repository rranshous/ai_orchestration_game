Let me fix the build errors in the mentioned files:

1. Fix the unused delay import in BaseAgentInterface.tsx
BaseAgentInterface.tsx+0-1
2. Fix the unused handlePullWork in ProjectSelector.tsx
ProjectSelector.tsx+1-6
3. Fix the unused fallbackToMock in modelService.ts
modelService.ts+6-0
4. Fix the unused getState in bossReducer.ts
bossReducer.ts+1-1
These changes should fix all the build errors by removing or properly handling the unused variables and imports.
