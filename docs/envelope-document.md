# AI Orchestrator - Implementation Plan Guide

## Introduction

This document serves as a guide to the complete implementation plan for the AI Orchestrator game. The implementation plan has been divided into multiple documents, each focusing on specific aspects of the system. This approach allows for better organization and more manageable content while providing comprehensive implementation details.

## Document Structure

The implementation plan consists of five separate documents that should be read in the following order:

1. **AI Orchestrator - Simplified MVP Overview**
2. **AI Orchestrator - Workspace and Agents**
3. **AI Orchestrator - Copy-Paste and Workflow**
4. **AI Orchestrator - Projects and Feedback**
5. **AI Orchestrator - Content and Implementation**

## Document Contents

### 1. AI Orchestrator - Simplified MVP Overview
This document provides a high-level introduction to the project and outlines:
- The core concept of the game
- Technical stack selection
- Project structure
- Key simplifications made for the MVP
- Overview of implementation documents

This should be read first to understand the game concept and overall approach.

### 2. AI Orchestrator - Workspace and Agents
This document details the primary UI components and interfaces:
- Workspace environment implementation
- AI agent data structures and interfaces
- Product Vision AI implementation
- Code Writer AI implementation
- Redux state management for agents

Read this second to understand the main UI components that players will interact with.

### 3. AI Orchestrator - Copy-Paste and Workflow
This document covers the core gameplay mechanics:
- Copy-paste system implementation
- Clipboard management
- Transfer validation
- Workflow system design
- Workflow visualization

Read this third to understand how the primary game interaction works.

### 4. AI Orchestrator - Projects and Feedback
This document details the project management and feedback systems:
- Project data structures
- Project generation system
- Project status tracking
- Feedback and notification systems
- Help system implementation

Read this fourth to understand how players interact with projects and receive feedback.

### 5. AI Orchestrator - Content and Implementation
This document provides implementation details for content generation and overall development:
- AI response templates
- Content generation system
- Phased implementation plan
- Testing strategy
- Auto-save system
- Visual asset requirements

Read this last to understand the technical implementation plan and development phases.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation plan is designed to be completed in three phases:

1. **Phase 1 (2 weeks)**: Core UI and Environment
2. **Phase 2 (2 weeks)**: Copy-Paste and Project Mechanics
3. **Phase 3 (1 week)**: Content and Polish

This phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, ensuring that the core gameplay mechanics are solid before adding additional features.

## Key Simplifications

To increase the likelihood of successful implementation, the following simplifications have been made for the MVP:

1. Two AI agents instead of three
2. Fixed panels instead of draggable windows
3. Simple linear workflow
4. Binary success/failure evaluation for projects
5. Minimal feedback system
6. Static help screens
7. Auto-save only

These simplifications reduce complexity while preserving the core satirical concept of being a human middleware in an AI-driven development process.

## Next Steps

Begin by reading the "AI Orchestrator - Simplified MVP Overview" document and then proceed through the remaining documents in the order specified above. Each document builds upon the concepts introduced in previous documents, providing a complete implementation plan for the AI Orchestrator game.
